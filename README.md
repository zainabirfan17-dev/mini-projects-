# 📝 Mini Python Projects

A collection of small but powerful Python projects that I built while learning programming.  
These projects are mostly **FreeCodeCamp (FCC) based**, with one custom-tweaked project of my own.  
Each project has a demo video linked for a live walkthrough.

## 📂 Projects

### 🔑 1. Vigenère Cipher (FCC-based)
A Python implementation of the classic **Vigenère Cipher** for text encryption and decryption.  
It demonstrates the use of modular arithmetic, looping, and string manipulation.

- **Features**:
  - Encrypts and decrypts text using a custom key.
  - Ignores non-alphabet characters like spaces and punctuation.
  - Example ciphertext: `"ty cpkg wv hnouaq"`

### 🔐 2. Encryption & Decryption (My Own Tweak 🚀)
This project is based on the **FCC Vigenère Cipher**, but with my **first custom tweak**.  
I added an **interactive mode** that lets the user choose whether to **encrypt** or **decrypt** their message.

- **Features**:
  - User-friendly input prompts.
  - Supports both encryption and decryption in one program.
  - First project where I applied my **own logic tweak** on top of FCC’s base idea.

### 💳 3. Credit Card Validator (Luhn Algorithm, FCC-based)
A program that verifies if a credit/debit card number is valid using the **Luhn Algorithm**.  
This is widely used by payment systems to quickly validate numbers.

- **Features**:
  - Handles spaces and dashes in card numbers.
  - Implements digit doubling and checksum validation.
  - Returns whether the card number is **VALID** or **INVALID**.

### 🔒 4. Secure Password Generator (FCC-based)
Generates strong, random passwords using Python’s `secrets` library.  
The generated password must satisfy multiple rules (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).

- **Features**:
  - Configurable password length.
  - Ensures at least one of each character type (digit, special char, uppercase, lowercase).
  - Uses cryptographically secure random generation.

### 🛤️ 5. Shortest Path Finder (FCC-based)
An implementation of **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.  
The graph is represented using adjacency lists.

- **Features**:
  - Prints shortest distances from a starting node to all other nodes.
  - Shows the exact path taken between nodes.
  - Example: Shortest path from A → F.
